Knife Dinner Impossible Plugin
============

This is the beginning of my idea for a knife plugin that will help do some assessment and discovery work about a chef-repo with the goal of making it better. I would love some input on this.

# Usage

## knife dinimp compare [COOKBOOK_DIR]

This compares the versions of all the cookbooks in the cookbooks directory passed to the command with the lastest version available in the Chef Supermarket. It gives a report of which ones are old, up-to-date or no longer in the Supermaket. I have plans to add a ```--gist``` option that would send the output to a secret gist.

Here is what the output looks like: (it's colorized in the terminal)

## knife dinimp diff

This command isn't developed yet, but this would diff each cookbook in the cookbooks directory with the Supermarketâ€™s cookbook of the same version and will send the diff output to the terminal. A secret gist by default would also be cool.
